## Context:

(same as previous assignment)

The 'client' for this site is a band from Montreal, QC called Sunforger. They are good friends of mine and are currently lacking a website. Many of the design choices were made in an attempt to match their general visual aesthetic.

The goal of this site is to provide some important information to potential fans in the form of 'Bio' and 'Tour Dates', as well as being a central hub with access to their social media and streaming sites. The 'Review' section was added to give new fans a descriptive flavour of their sound, and also showcase some of their press.

## Notes:

### Refactors from A3:
- Converted one page site into multi-page with a hero image landing page as the new index
- Added a contact page which includes an email submission form and an embedded google map

### Hero Page:
- I struggled to find an image from what Sunforger provided that was high enough resolution to serve as an appropriate hero image. I am aware that the image used has a bit of a 'blown up' look, but I decided it was my best option. That said, I do feel like the 'photo grainy' quality of the image works with their aesthetic and doesn't take away from the site too much. 

### Contact Page:
- I used [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to set up the contact form.
- Making the embedded map responsive proved to be difficult. I ended up using a set of CSS rulesets sourced online (linked in my attributes). I did not intend for the map to be full size, but the responsiveness did not seem to work properly otherwise. The full size map doesn't look bad, just not what I originally wanted.
- Map marker is our old studio in Montreal.
