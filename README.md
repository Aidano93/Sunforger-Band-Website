## Context:

(same as previous assignment)

The 'client' for this site is a band from Montreal, QC called Sunforger. They are good friends of mine and are currently lacking a website. Many of the design choices were made in an attempt to match their general visual aesthetic.

The goal of this site is to provide some important information to potential fans in the form of 'Bio' and 'Tour Dates', as well as being a central hub with access to their social media and streaming sites. The 'Review' section was added to give new fans a descriptive flavour of their sound, and also showcase some of their press.

## Notes:

### Refactors from A2:
- **Added social media links in main nav and footer**
- **Added gallery of 12 images related to Sunforger**
- fixed a size issue with the size of the logo in the header

### Gallery
- Images for this gallery were received in various aspect ratios and did not fit with each other. Rather than edit them in pixlr, I chose to set the height and width of each image in CSS and then use object-fit:cover. I chose a 1:1 ratio for the images and think they translate fairly well.
